Git is a version control program that is a tool that lets you track changes in a document and folder structure

First we learned the command print working directory
	
	pwd

Then make a directory
	
	mkdr
	
Switch into directory
	
	cd <directory name>
	
Create a new git repository which is a folder that contains a collection of code that is tracked by git
	
	git init
	
Download a text editor and create a new file called index.html which will show up in a web browser like chrome or safari
	
	<p>hello world</p>
	
Then when you type code below it will open in web browswer

	open index.html
	
Git does not yet track the changes to index.html it is in an area called unstaged changes

We want git to remember it and track future changes to that file

Our gaol is to take new changes and track them. We must move all of our new changes into the staged changes section. Once we have them in staged changes section we need to createa commit message that will label that point in history and then make the commit.

Commit is a point in history

The point of commits is to track changes which is helpful in case you are coding and you make soemthing that works and then you code more and it fucks it up but it doesn't have to undo all the work you've done.

Homework: just practice
